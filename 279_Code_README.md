To compile the following code, you will first need to run the Data_preprocessing_279 program. As stated in the comments, your file paths need to be correct and adjusted to where the Gardner_train_silver.csv and Gardner_test_gold_onlyGardnerScores.csv are located in your computer. After accounting for the file paths, run the program as is. Save the output .csv files at the very end of the program in the same folder as where the programs are being run (this will allow you to not have to worry about directories and file paths when running other programs/make minimal changes in file paths). 
To train the CNN that we built, open CNN_279.ipynb. Change the image_path variable to where the images of the blastocysts are in your computer. (Stored in the image folder within the Blastocyst_Dataset folder) Beyond that, run the file as is. This will lead you to have a fully trained CNN. 
To train the Random Forest model that we built, open sklearn_model_cs279.ipynb. First include the CellProfiler dataset in the same folder as this program labeled “BlastocystData_Image.csv” (the instructions for running CellProfiler for our dataset and generating said file are outlined in the 279_CellProfiler_README file). In the filter_string function, replace the file path to where your Blastocyst images are contained. Beyond that, run the file as is. This will lead you to have a fully trained Random Forest Model.
