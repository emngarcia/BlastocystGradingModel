To extract numerical features from the blastocyst dataset you must open the BlastocystPipelineFinal.cppproj file in CellProfiler 4.2.8. (BlastocystPipeline.cppproj will also work as is, however it contains other features not used in the final pipeline unselected) If the images are not automatically loaded you then must drop the image folder in Blastocyst_Dataset into the images tab of the window and then assign the name “BlastocystOriginal” to all images in the NamesandTypes tab. Then you must go into the “ExportToSpreadsheet” module and edit the output file location within it to go into the proper folder on your machine. Finally, press “Analyze Images” in the bottom left to run and save to a .csv. (Note: this may take around an hour)
